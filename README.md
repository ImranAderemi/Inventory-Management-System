This was my first challenging project created using C#. I call it the IMS (Inventory Management System), and it allows users to store, update, and visualise all of the items that they have in stock in one place. I found this project challenging particularly because it was my first official "solo" project using C#, meaning that I found myself frequently asking my peers, and google, for help with syntax errors.
